Classify one tabletop RPG subreddit post as exactly one label:
Question
Other

Use label "Question" if the post asks a question where the answer requires explaining, clarifying, or interpreting specific game mechanics, written rules (RAW/RAI), or rules adjudication—including questions about: legality of actions ("can I do X"), timing/sequencing, conditions/status effects, spell interactions, action economy, damage calculations, or character builds where rules compliance is the primary concern.
Use label "Other" for: story/lore questions, general GM advice without specific rules interpretation, homebrew content sharing, LFG/recruitment posts, game reviews, memes/humor, product discussions, session recaps/stories, crowdfunding/kickstarter promotions, meta-discussion about subreddits or community, or any non-rules topics.

Output only the label.
